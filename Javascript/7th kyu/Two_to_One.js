/*
Take 2 strings s1 and s2 including only letters from ato z. Return a new sorted string, the longest possible, containing distinct letters - each taken only once - coming from s1 or s2.

Examples:
a = "xyaabbbccccdefww"
b = "xxxxyyyyabklmopq"
longest(a, b) -> "abcdefklmopqwxy"

a = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
longest(a, a) -> "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
*/

//answer    
//combine both the strings and created an array with unique characters from both
//sorted the the unique characters
//then joined them and return the string of unique elements
const longest = (s1, s2) => [...new Set(s1+s2)].sort().join('')
