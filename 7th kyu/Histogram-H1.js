/*
DESCRIPTION:
Background
A 6-sided die is rolled a number of times and the results are plotted as a character-based histogram.

Example:

6|##### 5
5|
4|# 1
3|########## 10
2|### 3
1|####### 7
Task
You will be passed the dice value frequencies, and your task is to write the code to return a string representing a histogram, so that when it is printed it has the same format as the example.

Notes
There are no trailing spaces on the lines
All lines (including the last) end with a newline \n
A count is displayed beside each bar except where the count is 0
The number of rolls may vary but there are never more than 100

*/

//Solution  
function histogram(results) {
    //returned the frequency of the dice results as a histogram
    return results.map((x, i) => `${i + 1}|${'#'.repeat(x)}${x ? ' ' + x : ''}`).reverse().join('\n') + '\n'
}
