/*
Can you implement a function that will return number of words in a string?

You have to ensure that spaces in string is a whitespace for real.

Let's take a look on some examples:

countWords("Hello"); // returns 1 as int
countWords("Hello, World!") // returns 2
countWords("No results for search term `s`") // returns 6
countWords(" Hello") // returns 1
// ... and so on
What kind of tests we made for your code:

Function have to count words and not spaces. You have to be sure that you doing it right
Empty string has no words.
String with spaces around should be trimmed.
Non-whitespace (ex. breakspace, unicode chars) should be treated as a delimiter
Doublecheck that words with chars like -, ', ` are counted right.

//answer    
function countWords(str) {
    //replace all the breakspace and dash with white space
    //then trimmed the excess space before and after the string words
    //turned the string into an array of it's then filtered out the empty space before getting the array's length
    //minused the array length of str's '
    //return the difference of these two arrays
    return str.replace(/['ï»¿','-']/g,' ').trim().split(' ').filter(x=> x).length - [...str].filter(x=> x=="'").length
