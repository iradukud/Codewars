/*
Task
Coding in function bigToSmall. function accept 1 parameter arr(2D number array).

Your task is: First to all, refer to the example above, flat output arr to a one-dimensional array.

And then sort array in descending order.

Finally, use the separator ">" to connect the elements into a string.

Don't complain about the situation like 1>1 is not reasonable, it is just a separator.

Some example:

bigToSmall([[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]]) should return "6>5>4>3>2>1"
bigToSmall([[1,3,5],[2,4,6]]) should return "6>5>4>3>2>1"
bigToSmall([[1,1],[1],[1,1]]) should return "1>1>1>1>1"
*/

//answer    
function bigToSmall(arr) {
    //created an empty array
    let arr1 = []
    //joined the all the arrays into one then sorted the elements and joined with a '>' separator
    //and return the array
    return arr1.concat(...arr).sort((a, b) => b - a).join('>')
}
